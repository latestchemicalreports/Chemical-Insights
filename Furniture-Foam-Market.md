Furniture foam is a crucial material used in the production of furniture, including chairs, sofas, recliners, and other upholstered products. It provides comfort, durability, and structural integrity. The two primary types of furniture foam are polyurethane foam, which is plastic-based, and latex foam, which is rubber-based. These foams are widely utilized in residential, commercial, and industrial applications due to their cushioning properties and versatility.
