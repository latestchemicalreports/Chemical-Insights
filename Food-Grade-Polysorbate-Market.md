Polysorbates are a class of emulsifiers commonly used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries to improve the texture, stability, and solubility of ingredients. Derived from sorbitan and esterified with fatty acids, polysorbates are primarily employed to enhance the dispersion of oils and water-based substances. In the food industry, they serve as essential additives in baked goods, dairy products, confectionery, and beverages to maintain consistency and extend shelf life. The most commonly used food-grade polysorbates include Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, and Polysorbate 80, each with distinct properties suitable for various applications.

## Market Size

The global Food Grade Polysorbate market was valued at approximately USD 30 million in 2023. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.30%, reaching an estimated USD 40.28 million by 2030. This growth is attributed to increasing demand for emulsifiers in food production, rising consumer preference for processed and convenience foods, and expanding applications in the dairy and confectionery sectors.
