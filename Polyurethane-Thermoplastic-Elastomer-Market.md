Polyurethane Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPU) is a high-performance polymer that combines the elasticity of rubber with the durability and processability of plastic. It is a type of block copolymer consisting of alternating soft and hard segments, where the soft segment provides flexibility, and the hard segment gives strength and structural integrity. TPU is widely used in various industries due to its exceptional resistance to abrasion, chemicals, and temperature variations.

## Market Size

The global Polyurethane Thermoplastic Elastomer market was valued at approximately USD 34,370 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 49,337.61 million by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.30%. The North American market alone was valued at USD 8,955.84 million in 2023 and is expected to experience steady growth at a CAGR of 4.54% between 2025 and 2030.
