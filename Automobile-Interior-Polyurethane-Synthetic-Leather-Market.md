Polyurethane synthetic leather, commonly known as PU leather, is a versatile and cost-effective alternative to genuine leather, widely used in automobile interiors. PU leather is produced by coating a fabric base, such as polyester or cotton, with a layer of polyurethane, mimicking the texture, feel, and appearance of real leather. This material is gaining popularity due to its affordability, durability, and ease of maintenance compared to traditional leather.

## Market Size

The global automobile interior polyurethane synthetic leather market was valued at USD 367 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 537.42 million by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.60% during the forecast period. North America’s market size reached USD 95.63 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 4.80% from 2025 through 2030.
