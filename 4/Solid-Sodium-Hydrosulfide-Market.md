Solid sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is an inorganic compound primarily used in various industrial applications. It appears as an orange or yellow solid that is highly deliquescent, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Upon reaching its melting point, NaHS decomposes, releasing hydrogen sulfide gas. This compound is easily soluble in water and alcohol, making it versatile for numerous chemical and industrial uses.

Solid sodium hydrosulfide is a crucial chemical in several industries, including dye manufacturing, leather processing, wastewater treatment, mining, and artificial fiber production. It serves as a raw material in the synthesis of ammonium sulfide and pesticide ethanethiol intermediates. Given its chemical properties, it is also employed as an auxiliary agent for sulfide dye production.

## Market Size

The global solid sodium hydrosulfide market was valued at USD 138.50 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 171.50 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.10% during the forecast period. The North American market accounted for USD 36.09 million in 2023, with a forecasted CAGR of 2.66% between 2025 and 2030.

This steady growth is fueled by increasing demand in key industries such as mining, wastewater treatment, and leather processing. The market expansion is further driven by rising industrialization, especially in developing regions.
