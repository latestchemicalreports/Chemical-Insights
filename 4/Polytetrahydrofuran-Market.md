Polytetrahydrofuran (PTMEG) is a white waxy solid that becomes a transparent liquid beyond room temperature. It is dissoluble in alcohol, ester, ketone, aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons but insoluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons and water. PTMEG is primarily used in producing high-performance Spandex fibers, known for their superior hydrolysis and microbe resistance, excellent resistance to abrasion and wear, and optimal low-temperature performance.

Market Size

The global PTMEG market was valued at USD 3,264.60 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 4,125.47 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.40% during the forecast period. The North American market was valued at USD 850.66 million in 2023, with a forecasted CAGR of 2.91% from 2025 to 2030.
