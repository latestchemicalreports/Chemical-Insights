Phytase is a crucial enzyme widely used in poultry feed to enhance phosphorus availability from plant-based sources. It helps in breaking down phytic acid, a naturally occurring anti-nutrient in grains and oilseeds, into more digestible forms of phosphorus.

Derived primarily from microbial sources such as Pichia pastoris, phytase is available in different formulations, including granular, powder, liquid, and thermostable forms. By supplementing poultry diets with phytase, farmers can enhance nutrient utilization, reduce feed costs, and minimize phosphorus excretion into the environment, addressing both economic and ecological concerns.

## Market Size

The global phytase enzyme for poultry market was valued at USD 175 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 249.54 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 5.20% during the forecast period.

North America accounted for USD 45.60 million in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 4.46% through 2030.

Increased demand for cost-effective and sustainable poultry feed additives is driving market expansion.

The adoption of precision feeding strategies is further propelling market growth.

The market is expected to grow due to rising poultry production, stringent environmental regulations on phosphorus emissions, and advancements in enzyme engineering.
