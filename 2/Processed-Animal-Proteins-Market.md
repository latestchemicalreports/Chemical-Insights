Processed animal protein is a highly nutritious protein source derived exclusively from low-risk material from healthy animals declared fit for human consumption after a thorough inspection before slaughter. These proteins are typically obtained from rendering animal by-products such as bones, blood, and offal, which are then processed into protein-rich meals used in various applications, including animal feed, pet food, and fertilizers.

The demand for processed animal proteins has grown due to their high protein content, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability benefits. They provide essential amino acids and nutrients, making them a valuable component in livestock and aquaculture nutrition. The industry adheres to strict regulatory standards to ensure safety and quality in processing and distribution.

## Market Size

The global processed animal proteins market was valued at USD 275 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 427.35 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.50% during the forecast period. This steady growth is attributed to the rising demand for high-quality animal feed, increasing pet ownership, and a growing focus on sustainable waste management practices.

**Market Trends**

Increased Demand for Sustainable Feed Ingredients: Consumers and industries are shifting toward sustainable and ethical animal protein sources, increasing the demand for processed animal proteins in livestock and aquaculture.
