Silicone Pressure Sensitive Adhesives (PSA) are a type of non-reactive adhesive that bonds with surfaces when pressure is applied. Unlike traditional adhesives, they do not require solvents, water, or heat to activate. PSAs are widely used in pressure-sensitive tapes, labels, glue dots, stickers, sticky note pads, and automobile trims. Their key applications span across the electronics, automotive, aerospace, and healthcare industries due to their superior adhesive properties, flexibility, and durability.

Silicone-based PSAs, in particular, offer high-temperature resistance, excellent chemical stability, and superior adhesion to challenging surfaces. They come in various formulations, including solvent-based, solventless, water-based, and UV-curable options. With technological advancements, the adoption of these adhesives is increasing, especially in high-performance applications such as protective films for electronic displays, circuit board masking tapes, and medical-grade adhesive solutions.
