Food Grade Potassium Carbonate is a white, odorless, water-soluble inorganic compound primarily used in the food and beverage industry. It is a highly alkaline substance, serving as a buffering agent, pH regulator, and stabilizer. This compound is preferred in food processing because it alters the taste of products minimally compared to other carbonates.

## Market Size

The global Food Grade Potassium Carbonate market was valued at USD 50 million in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 67.14 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.30% during the forecast period. North America accounted for USD 13.03 million in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.69% from 2025 to 2030.
