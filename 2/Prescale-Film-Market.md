Prescale Film is a unique pressure-sensitive film that enables users to measure pressure distribution and magnitude. This technology allows industries to visualize and quantify pressure in ways that were previously impossible. The film contains microcapsules that break when pressure is applied, producing a red coloration that indicates the intensity and distribution of force. This capability is critical in applications such as automotive, electronics, and industrial testing, where precision pressure measurement is necessary.

Market Size

The global Prescale Film market was valued at USD 776.40 million in 2023 and is expected to grow to USD 1,070.81 million by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.70% during the forecast period.

North America accounted for USD 202.31 million in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.03% from 2025 to 2030.

Growth is being driven by increasing demand in automotive, electronics, and semiconductor industries.

Technological advancements in sensor-based pressure measurement solutions may pose a competitive challenge to traditional Prescale Film products.
