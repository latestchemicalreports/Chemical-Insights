Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) Resin is a water-soluble synthetic polymer widely used for its adhesive and film-forming properties. It is commonly applied in industries such as coatings, adhesives, textiles, packaging, and water-soluble films. PVA resin is known for its excellent bonding strength, flexibility, high tensile strength, resistance to oils and grease, and biodegradability, making it a versatile material across various industrial and consumer applications.

## Market Size

The global Polyvinyl Alcohol Resin market was valued at USD 3,651 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 4,676.60 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.60% during the forecast period. The North American market accounted for USD 951.35 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 3.09% between 2025 and 2030. Increasing demand from the packaging, textile, and adhesives industries is driving this growth.
