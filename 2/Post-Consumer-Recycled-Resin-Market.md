Post-consumer resin (PCR) refers to plastic materials that have been reclaimed and reprocessed from consumer and industrial packaging waste. These materials include plastic films, bottles, milk jugs, buckets, and industrial packaging such as IBC totes and poly drums. Once collected, these plastics undergo sorting, cleaning, and processing to be repurposed into new plastic products, contributing to sustainability efforts and reducing environmental waste.

Market Size

The global Post Consumer Recycled Resin market was valued at USD 29,670 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 35,752.85 million by 2030, reflecting a CAGR of 2.70% during the forecast period. North America accounted for USD 7,731.15 million in 2023, with a forecasted CAGR of 2.31% from 2025 to 2030. This steady market growth is driven by rising regulatory policies on plastic waste management, increasing consumer awareness of sustainability, and the expanding application of PCR across industries such as packaging, construction, and textiles.
