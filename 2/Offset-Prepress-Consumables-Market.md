Offset prepress consumables refer to the essential materials used in the preparation stages before the final printing process in offset printing. These consumables are crucial for ensuring high-quality printing and efficient operations. They include printing plates, chemicals, and other materials used in the prepress stage to prepare images, text, and layouts for magazines, books, newspapers, and packaging materials.

The offset prepress process involves converting digital designs into physical printing plates, which are then used on offset presses. This technology is widely utilized in commercial printing due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to produce consistent, high-resolution prints in bulk.
