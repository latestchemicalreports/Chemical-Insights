Potassium hydroxide (KOH), commonly referred to as caustic potash, is an inorganic compound that appears as an odorless, white or slightly yellow, flakey, or lumpy solid. It is highly soluble in water and forms a strong alkaline solution. KOH is widely used in various industries, including chemical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. Its strong alkaline properties make it essential in the production of biodiesel, soaps, and detergents, among other applications.

## Market Size

The global potassium hydroxide (KOH) market was valued at approximately USD 3010.70 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 3627.94 million by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.70% during the forecast period. The market's steady growth is driven by increasing industrial applications and the rising demand for potassium-based chemicals.

North America Market Size

North America's potassium hydroxide market was estimated at USD 784.50 million in 2023, with a CAGR of 2.31% for the period between 2025 and 2030. The region's demand is fueled by the presence of major chemical manufacturers and a well-established industrial sector.
