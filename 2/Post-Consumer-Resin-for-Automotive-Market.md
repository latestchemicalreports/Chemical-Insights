Post-consumer resin (PCR) for automotive refers to recycled plastic materials derived from post-consumer sources that are used in the manufacturing of automotive components. These materials are collected, processed, and repurposed to create sustainable automotive parts, reducing environmental impact and promoting circular economy practices in the automotive industry.

PCR materials such as polypropylene, ABS, polycarbonate, and polyphenylene ether are commonly used in vehicle interiors, exteriors, engine parts, and automotive electronics. The adoption of PCR aligns with global sustainability initiatives and regulatory mandates aimed at reducing plastic waste and promoting green manufacturing.

## Market Size

The global Post Consumer Resin (PCR) for Automotive market was valued at USD 1,679 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 2,254.45 million by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.30% during the forecast period.

North America’s PCR for Automotive market was valued at USD 437.50 million in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 3.69% between 2025 and 2030. Increasing government regulations on plastic waste reduction and rising consumer demand for sustainable automotive products are key factors driving this growth.
