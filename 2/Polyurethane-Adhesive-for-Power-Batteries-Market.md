Polyurethane adhesives offer a robust combination of strength and flexibility, making them essential for applications requiring durability. In the power battery sector, these adhesives play a critical role in assembling battery packs for electric and hybrid vehicles. They are available in one-component and two-component formulations and exhibit excellent adhesion properties. However, their performance may degrade at prolonged high temperatures above 302°F (150°C). Their chemical resistance and mechanical stability make them ideal for use in electric vehicle (EV) battery assembly, ensuring secure bonding and structural integrity.

## Market Size

The global Polyurethane Adhesive for Power Batteries market was valued at USD 166.20 million in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 305.78 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.10% during the forecast period. North America accounted for USD 43.31 million in 2023, with an anticipated growth rate of 7.80% CAGR from 2025 to 2030. The increasing adoption of EVs, driven by stringent emission norms and government incentives, fuels the demand for polyurethane adhesives in battery pack assembly.
