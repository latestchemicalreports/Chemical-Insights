Prepreg is a composite material composed of "pre-impregnated" fibers and a partially cured polymer matrix. The fibers, which are typically arranged in a weave, are bonded together by a resin system such as epoxy, phenolic, or thermoplastic. This advanced material is widely utilized in aerospace and defense due to its superior strength-to-weight ratio, making it an essential component in manufacturing aircraft structures, military equipment, and other high-performance applications.

## Market Size

The global Aerospace and Defense Prepreg market was valued at USD 6,612 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 12,560.49 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.60%. North America's market stood at USD 1,722.90 million in 2023, with an expected CAGR of 8.23% between 2025 and 2030. This significant growth is attributed to the increasing demand for lightweight, high-strength materials in the aerospace sector, along with advancements in manufacturing technologies.
