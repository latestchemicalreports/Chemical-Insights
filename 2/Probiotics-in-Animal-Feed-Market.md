Probiotics in animal feed refer to live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, provide health benefits to animals. These beneficial bacteria and yeasts help in improving gut health, enhancing immunity, and boosting overall productivity in livestock. Probiotics are commonly incorporated into feed for cattle, poultry, swine, aquaculture, and other farm animals to optimize digestion and nutrient absorption while reducing reliance on antibiotics.

## Market Size

The global probiotics in animal feed market was valued at USD 3,897.40 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 5,198.15 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 4.20%. The increasing demand for high-quality animal protein and sustainable livestock farming practices are key drivers of market growth. In North America, the market size was USD 1,015.55 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 3.60% from 2025 to 2030. The rising awareness of gut health, coupled with stringent regulations on antibiotic use in animal feed, is expected to drive significant growth in the coming years.
