Potassium bisulfite, commonly known as potassium hydrogen sulfite, is a chemical compound with a strong sulfurous odor. It is primarily used as a food preservative, antioxidant, and sterilizing agent. The compound reacts with acids present in food, releasing sulfur dioxide (SO2), which effectively inhibits the growth of harmful microorganisms. Due to its versatile applications, potassium hydrogen sulfite is extensively used in the food & beverage industry, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, wastewater treatment, and photography.

## Market Size

The global potassium hydrogen sulfite market was valued at USD 168 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 221.08 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.00% during the forecast period. The North American market alone was valued at USD 43.78 million in 2023, with a forecasted CAGR of 3.43% from 2025 to 2030. The increasing demand for food preservatives and wastewater treatment solutions are key growth drivers fueling this market.
