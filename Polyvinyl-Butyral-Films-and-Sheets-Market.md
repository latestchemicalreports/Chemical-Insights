Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) Films and Sheets are crucial materials used in various industries, including architecture and automotive, due to their unique chemical properties and versatility. These films and sheets are primarily used as interlayers in laminated glass, where they are fused between two layers of glass to create a durable, high-performance material. PVB films offer significant benefits such as enhanced impact resistance, UV protection, sound insulation, and the ability to hold shattered glass together. This makes PVB a key component in ensuring safety and functionality in both commercial and residential buildings as well as vehicles.

In the automotive industry, PVB films are typically used in windshields and side windows, offering superior protection in the event of an accident. The laminated glass created with PVB ensures that shards of glass stay attached to the interlayer, reducing the risk of injury. In architecture, PVB films are widely used in windows, facades, and skylights, not only for safety but also for thermal and acoustic performance. The growing demand for safer, more energy-efficient building designs has significantly boosted the adoption of PVB films across the globe.
