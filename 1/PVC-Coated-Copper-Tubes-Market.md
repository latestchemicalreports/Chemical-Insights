PVC Coated Copper Tubes are specialized tubes that combine the high conductivity and durability of copper with the protective properties of a PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) coating. These tubes are widely used in a variety of industries for applications that require enhanced protection against corrosion, moisture, and chemicals. The PVC coating provides an additional layer of protection, ensuring that the copper tube can withstand harsher environments without degradation. This makes them ideal for use in plumbing, refrigeration systems, air conditioning units, and electrical cables.

The PVC-coated copper tube market is driven by the growing demand for materials that offer both structural integrity and resilience. Copper’s excellent thermal and electrical conductivity combined with PVC's robust protective features makes these tubes highly suitable for use in industrial and consumer applications where corrosion resistance is critical. The growing demand for energy-efficient cooling systems and the need for safer electrical installations further propel the adoption of PVC-coated copper tubes in various sectors.
