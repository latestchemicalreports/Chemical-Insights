Non-wood pulp refers to the fibrous material produced from sources other than traditional wood pulp, including agricultural residues, fiber crops, waste paper, and rags. It is commonly used in the production of various types of paper and other products, serving as an alternative to wood pulp. Non-wood pulp is typically produced by mechanically or chemically separating cellulose fibers from raw materials, resulting in a versatile product with a range of applications in the paper industry.

While wood pulp has been the standard for paper production for centuries, non-wood pulp is increasingly becoming a preferred option due to its eco-friendly and sustainable properties. This shift is driven by concerns over deforestation, the environmental impact of logging, and the need for more sustainable production practices. Non-wood pulp can be derived from a variety of sources such as bamboo, straw, cotton, kenaf, and bagasse, among others, which contribute to its growing popularity in the global paper and pulp market.
