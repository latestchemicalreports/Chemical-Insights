ePU-based reactive hot melt adhesive is a specialized adhesive formulation known for its superior bonding properties. Unlike conventional hot melt adhesives that rely on cooling to solidify, PU-based reactive hot melts undergo a chemical curing process. This involves polymerization and cross-linking reactions triggered by environmental factors such as moisture or heat, leading to high-performance adhesive bonds. These adhesives are widely used in industries including automotive, packaging, textiles, electronics, and construction due to their superior flexibility, durability, and resistance to moisture and chemicals.
