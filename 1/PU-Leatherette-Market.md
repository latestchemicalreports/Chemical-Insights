PU synthetic leather, also known as polyurethane leather or leatherette, is an artificial alternative to genuine leather. It is widely utilized in industries such as footwear, fashion, furniture, automotive interiors, and accessories. PU leather is crafted by coating fabric materials like cotton or polyester with polyurethane, giving it a leather-like texture and aesthetic appeal. Unlike natural leather, PU leather is more affordable, highly durable, and easier to maintain, making it a preferred choice across multiple industries.

PU synthetic leather boasts a range of advantages, including high abrasion resistance, excellent flexibility, and enhanced breathability. Additionally, it is environmentally friendly compared to PVC-based alternatives due to the absence of harmful dioxins. The growing demand for animal-free and sustainable materials in fashion and upholstery has significantly contributed to the market expansion of PU synthetic leather.
