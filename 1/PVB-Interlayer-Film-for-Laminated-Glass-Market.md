PVB (Polyvinyl Butyral) Interlayer Film for Laminated Glass is a specialized material used to bond layers of glass together to enhance safety, performance, and comfort. The film is typically made of a polymer resin, known for its high optical clarity, strength, and flexibility, which makes it an ideal material for laminated glass applications. When applied to glass, PVB interlayers act as a binding agent, preventing the glass from shattering upon impact and significantly reducing the risk of injury in the event of an accident.

PVB interlayer films are essential in the automotive and architectural industries. In automotive applications, they are used in windshields, windows, and other glass components to improve the overall safety of vehicles. In architecture, they are used in windows and glass facades to increase the strength and durability of buildings. Beyond their safety benefits, PVB films offer additional advantages, such as enhanced sound insulation, UV protection, and improved thermal insulation, making them a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.
