Sodium silicate, commonly known as waterglass, is an inorganic chemical compound produced by fusing sand (silica) and soda ash (sodium carbonate) at high temperatures. The chemical reaction between silica and sodium carbonate results in a wide variety of sodium silicate products, depending on the ratio of sand to soda ash used during the production process. The different types of sodium silicate produced have varying properties and applications, making it a highly versatile chemical with broad industrial uses.

Technical grade sodium silicate, a specific form of sodium silicate, is characterized by its high purity and is used across various sectors, including construction, automotive, detergent manufacturing, and as an industrial adhesive. Its versatile properties, such as its ability to act as a binder, an adhesive, and a sealant, have made it indispensable in many industrial processes. It is also used as a cement binder and in coatings, paints, and ceramics, thanks to its ability to improve product strength, durability, and resistance to moisture and chemicals.
