Polyvinyl Acetate (PVAc) emulsions are water-based adhesives widely used across multiple industries due to their strong adhesion properties and versatility. These emulsions are primarily used in wood glues, paper adhesives, coatings, packaging, and construction applications. PVAc emulsions are preferred for their non-toxic nature, quick drying time, and ability to bond porous materials like wood, paper, and textiles. Their superior binding properties make them an essential component in industries such as furniture manufacturing, paper lamination, and bookbinding.
