Functional silane crosslinkers are specialized organosilicon compounds characterized by the presence of two distinct chemical groups in their molecular structure. These compounds act as coupling agents, improving the adhesion and bonding strength between organic polymers and inorganic substrates.

They are commonly utilized in industries like construction, automotive, electronics, and packaging for applications such as sealants, adhesives, coatings, and composites. By enhancing the interfacial compatibility between disparate materials, functional silane crosslinkers contribute to improved durability, water resistance, and mechanical properties.
