Cosmetic Grade Sodium Polyglutamate is an eco-friendly polymer that is derived from glutamic acid, a naturally occurring amino acid. It is widely used in the skincare industry due to its ability to retain moisture, which helps improve skin hydration and elasticity. As a long-term moisturizer, Sodium Polyglutamate has gained popularity due to its superior moisturizing effects, which are considered better than traditional hydrating agents like sodium hyaluronate and collagen.

This polymer works by forming a thin, non-greasy film on the skin that attracts and holds moisture, providing the skin with continuous hydration. It also contributes to enhancing skin elasticity and reducing the formation of wrinkles. Due to its natural origin and biocompatibility, Sodium Polyglutamate is seen as a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic moisturizers and preservatives.
