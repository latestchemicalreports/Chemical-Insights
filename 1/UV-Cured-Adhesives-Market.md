UV-cured adhesives are adhesives that undergo polymerization and curing when exposed to UV light. These adhesives are typically based on photoinitiators that activate once exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The use of UV light to trigger curing offers multiple advantages, including faster processing times, minimal heat generation, and the ability to bond a wide range of materials, including plastics, metals, glass, and wood. This curing process results in a durable and high-strength bond, making UV-cured adhesives popular across many industries.

The core benefit of UV-cured adhesives is their ability to cure in seconds, which is especially beneficial in industries that require quick assembly or production times. Additionally, UV adhesives are commonly used in precision bonding, where traditional adhesives might not offer the required precision.

## Market Size

The global UV-cured adhesives market was valued at approximately USD 381 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 478.22 million by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 3.30% during the forecast period. The growth of the market can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing demand for eco-friendly adhesive solutions, the need for faster production times, and advancements in UV adhesive technology.

In North America, the UV-cured adhesives market size was estimated at USD 99.28 million in 2023, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.83% between 2025 and 2032.
