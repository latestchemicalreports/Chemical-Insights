Micronized Silica, also known as silica fume or micro silica, is an ultrafine powder primarily collected as a by-product during the production of silicon and ferrosilicon alloys. With an average particle size of approximately 0.15 microns, silica fume consists of spherical particles that are less than 1 micron in diameter, making it a highly reactive and versatile material. Due to its fine particle size, silica fume exhibits unique properties that make it valuable in a variety of industrial applications, including concrete production, paints and coatings, adhesives, rubber, and personal care products.

The silica fume market is driven by its increasing use in the construction and automotive industries, where it enhances the strength, durability, and longevity of materials. Additionally, it is gaining popularity in high-performance applications like the electronics and pharmaceuticals industries, contributing to its growing demand globally.
