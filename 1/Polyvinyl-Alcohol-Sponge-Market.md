Polyvinyl Alcohol Sponge (PVA Sponge) is a synthetic, highly absorbent material made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). PVA is a polymer known for its excellent film-forming, emulsifying, and adhesive properties. The PVA sponge is an open-celled, porous material designed to hold large amounts of liquid, typically water, and wicks aqueous solutions rapidly due to its highly absorbent nature. PVA sponges are compressible when dry, expand when wet, and exhibit high tensile strength, good elongation, and resistance to various chemicals and solvents.

Due to its hydrophilic (water-attracting) properties, PVA sponge can absorb up to 12 times its dry weight in water, making it useful in various applications where high absorbency is crucial. PVA sponges are also noted for their durability under wet and dry conditions, withstanding temperatures up to 70°C when hydrated and 100°C when dry. Additionally, these sponges are inert, meaning they don't support microbial growth, and can be treated chemically to prevent mould and bacterial growth in wet-packed sponges.
