Pultruded Carbon Plates are high-performance materials primarily used for reinforcement and repair in engineering and construction projects. These plates are produced by aligning carbon fibers in the same direction and impregnating them with epoxy resin. The process of pultrusion involves drawing the resin-impregnated carbon fibers through a heated die, which molds the material into a rigid form as it hardens. The resulting plates offer exceptional strength, durability, and lightweight properties, making them ideal for a wide range of structural applications.

Pultruded carbon plates are highly valued in industries that require materials with a high strength-to-weight ratio, such as construction, aerospace, automotive, and marine industries. These plates are used in applications where the traditional reinforcement materials, like steel or concrete, might not provide the required performance due to weight or corrosion concerns.
