Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) emulsions are stable aqueous dispersions of plasticized PVB, primarily used as a binder, performance-enhancing additive, or stand-alone product in coatings. These emulsions are widely utilized in strippable (peelable) coatings, water-borne coatings, and textile coatings. PVB dispersions offer excellent film-forming capabilities, strong adhesion properties, and enhanced flexibility, making them suitable for multiple industrial applications. Due to their high durability, chemical resistance, and eco-friendly nature, PVB emulsions have gained significant traction in the coatings and adhesives industry.
