Polyurethane Reactive (PUR) adhesives, commonly referred to as PUR Hot Melt Glues, are high-performance adhesives with 100% solid content. These adhesives consist of isocyanate (NCO) capped resins that react with moisture in the environment, forming stronger, more durable bonds upon curing. They are widely used in industries such as automotive, packaging, woodworking, electronics, and construction due to their superior bonding strength and resistance to heat, chemicals, and moisture.
