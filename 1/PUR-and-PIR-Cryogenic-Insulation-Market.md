PUR (Polyurethane) and PIR (Polyisocyanurate) cryogenic insulation products are highly efficient thermal insulators used to maintain extremely low temperatures, especially in the storage and transportation of gases such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), oxygen, nitrogen, and other cryogenic liquids. These materials are chosen for their excellent thermal insulating properties, high strength-to-weight ratio, and versatility in manufacturing.

Polyurethane and polyisocyanurate are rigid foam materials that provide exceptional thermal resistance, with PIR being an enhanced version of PUR, offering better fire resistance and higher thermal stability. PUR and PIR cryogenic insulation are typically used for tank insulation, pipeline insulation, and other industrial applications requiring the preservation of low temperatures over extended periods.
