Chemical pulp is a type of pulp produced by chemically breaking down the lignocellulosic structure of wood, fiber crops, waste paper, or rags. It is primarily used in paper production and other industrial applications requiring high-strength fibers. The chemical pulping process, including methods like the Kraft process, dissolves the lignin and hemicellulose that bind the cellulose fibers, resulting in long, strong, and flexible fibers ideal for paper and packaging materials.

In the context of the chemical pulp market, the key products involve bleached and unbleached kraft pulp, sulfite pulp, and other specialty pulp types. Chemical pulp is distinguished from mechanical pulp, as it retains more of the cellulose content, offering superior strength and durability for its end uses. This process involves rigorous chemical treatments to separate the cellulose from the wood, ensuring that the resulting pulp meets stringent quality standards in industries like paper manufacturing, textiles, and more.
