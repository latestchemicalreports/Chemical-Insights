PU (Polyurethane) Metal Wall Panels are high-performance construction materials designed for superior insulation, durability, and aesthetic appeal. These panels consist of three primary layers: a strong metal skin for external protection, a polyurethane insulation core for thermal efficiency, and an aluminum foil paper backplane for enhanced structural stability. They are widely used in both residential and commercial buildings due to their lightweight nature, energy efficiency, and low maintenance requirements.
