Sheet lead, a highly durable and versatile material, has been the cornerstone of radiation shielding solutions, particularly in x-ray rooms and medical imaging facilities. Due to its low neutron absorption levels, sheet lead effectively prevents secondary radiation emission. Notably, even after extended exposure to radiation, sheet lead does not become radioactive, making it a safe and reliable choice for long-term use.
