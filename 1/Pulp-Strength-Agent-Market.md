Pulp strength agents are specialized chemicals used in the industrial paper and pulp industry to enhance the strength and stability of pulp. These agents are crucial in the production of paper products, as they increase the fiber bonding strength and improve the quality and durability of the final paper product.

The primary components of pulp strength agents include polymer starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and chemical additives, along with cellulosic amylase enzymes. Polymer starch and PVA help in strengthening the pulp fibers, while enzymes assist in improving fiber efficiency during the pulping process. These agents are commonly applied in various stages of pulp production, including wet-end processes and during the sheet formation, to ensure that the final product has adequate strength, durability, and functionality.
