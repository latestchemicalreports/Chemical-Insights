Powder Glass, also known as Glass Pastes, is a specialized material created by grinding glass into a fine powder. This powder is combined with a binder to form a paste and then mixed with a fluxing medium to facilitate its melting during application. Powder Glass is often used in various industrial applications, particularly in electronics, semiconductors, and other sectors where high-performance materials are required. The versatility of Powder Glass allows it to be tailored for specific uses by altering the blending ratio and the types of glass and ceramics employed. This customization makes Powder Glass valuable for applications that require precise thermal expansion coefficients or specific sealing temperatures.

**Key Characteristics of Powder Glass:**

Fine Powder Formulation: Powder Glass is produced by grinding glass into a very fine powder.

Binder Addition: A binder is added to the powder to create a paste-like consistency.

Fluxing Medium: A fluxing agent is included to aid the glass paste in melting at the desired temperature.

Thermal Expansion Control: By adjusting the composition, the sealing temperature and thermal expansion coefficient can be modified to suit specific applications.

This product is mainly utilized in sectors where high precision and specific physical properties are required, such as in the manufacturing of LEDs, OLEDs, and various home appliances.
