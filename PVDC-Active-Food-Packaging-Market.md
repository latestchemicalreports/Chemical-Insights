Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) is a high-barrier polymer primarily used in food packaging due to its excellent moisture and oxygen resistance. It enhances the appearance of packaging by providing gloss, transparency, print adhesion, and scratch resistance. PVDC-based active food packaging helps extend the shelf life of perishable food items, ensuring freshness and safety for consumers.

## Market Size

The global PVDC Active Food Packaging market was valued at USD 14,690 million in 2023 and is expected to grow to USD 23,282.01 million by 2030, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.80% during the forecast period. North America accounted for USD 3,827.79 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 5.83% from 2025 to 2030. Increasing demand for sustainable and high-performance packaging solutions is expected to drive market growth.
