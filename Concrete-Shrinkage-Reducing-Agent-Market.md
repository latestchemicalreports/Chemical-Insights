Shrinkage-reducing admixtures (SRAs) are specialized chemical agents used in concrete to mitigate the effects of shrinkage, particularly drying and self-desiccation. These admixtures function by reducing the surface tension of water within the concrete, thereby minimizing the formation of cracks caused by shrinkage. SRAs are utilized in relatively large quantities due to the extensive liquid–vapor interfacial area that emerges during the drying process.

Hardened cementitious materials possess an extensive internal surface area, often covered by liquid films, creating a significant interface where SRAs must operate. By enhancing dimensional stability, SRAs play a pivotal role in ensuring the durability and longevity of concrete structures, particularly in high-performance and large-scale applications.
