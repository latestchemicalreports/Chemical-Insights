Acoustic sensors are devices that utilize piezoelectric materials to generate and detect acoustic waves, enabling the measurement of various physical or chemical properties. These sensors operate based on the propagation of acoustic waves, where changes in the propagation path influence the wave’s velocity or amplitude, which can then be measured and analyzed. Piezoelectric materials such as quartz, lithium niobate (LiNbO3), aluminum nitride (AlN), and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) are commonly used in acoustic sensors. The sensors find applications in multiple industries, including telecommunications, automotive, aerospace, and environmental monitoring.

Market Size

The global acoustic sensors market was valued at USD 85 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 130.36 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.30% during the forecast period. North America accounted for USD 22.15 million in 2023 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.40% from 2024 to 2030.
