Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC) Polyimide (PI) films are essential materials in the electronics industry, primarily serving as the base insulating layer for flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs). These films are widely utilized in consumer electronics, 5G communication, automotive electronics, and other high-performance applications due to their exceptional thermal stability, chemical resistance, and dimensional stability. The key function of FPC PI films is to enhance the reliability and longevity of electronic circuits by protecting them from environmental and mechanical stresses.

FPC PI films are typically laminated with copper foil to form Flexible Copper Clad Laminates (FCCLs), which are used to create lightweight, durable, and highly flexible circuit solutions. Additionally, these films serve as cover layers to protect circuit traces from oxidation, corrosion, and external damage. As the demand for miniaturized and high-density electronic devices grows, the role of FPC PI films becomes increasingly vital in advanced technology sectors.
