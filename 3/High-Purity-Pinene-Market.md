Pinene refers to a collection of unsaturated bicyclic monoterpenes, found in nature primarily as two geometric isomers: alpha-pinene (α-pinene) and beta-pinene (β-pinene). Both compounds belong to the terpene class, which is characterized by molecules composed of multiple isoprene units. Alpha-pinene is particularly notable for its presence in the oils of coniferous trees, such as pine, and other plants like rosemary and Satureja myrtifolia. Beta-pinene, on the other hand, is known for its woody, pine-like scent and is often found in essential oils, including those derived from eucalyptus and orange peel.

These compounds, due to their distinct molecular structures, exhibit different chemical properties and uses, making them highly valuable across various industries. Alpha-pinene, with its characteristic structure, is often utilized as a fragrance ingredient in products like perfumes and cleaning agents. Beta-pinene, with its different structural makeup, finds applications in creating resins and solvents.

In the context of high purity pinene, the market primarily deals with purified forms of these compounds, used in high-demand applications such as fragrances, terpene resins, and pharmaceutical intermediates.
